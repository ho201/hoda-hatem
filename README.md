I'm Hoda Hatem

I'm a Computer Science student at the Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University.

I started learning programming a few months ago, and I'm really enjoying the journey so far.  
Right now, I'm focusing on front-end web development — I’ve already learned HTML and CSS, and I’m planning to dive into JavaScript soon, then move on to React.

I also have a solid foundation in C++, and I’ve taken a beginner Python course.  
In the future, I’d love to learn more about Artificial Intelligence and work on meaningful projects that solve real problems.

My goal is to become a skilled developer, build a strong portfolio, and eventually start working with clients or companies who believe in what I can offer.



Skills

- Languages: HTML, CSS, C++, Python  
- Learning: JavaScript  
- Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Canva



Projects

Coffee Machine Program  
A simple Python project that simulates a coffee vending machine.  
It asks the user to choose a drink, checks if resources are enough, processes coins, and returns change if needed.  
It also includes a report function and shutdown option.

Text Encryption Program  
This Python program lets the user encrypt and decrypt messages using a basic Caesar cipher.  
It was a great way to practice loops, strings, and user input.

Simple Calculator  
A small calculator made with Python. It handles basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
Perfect for getting used to functions and conditionals.

Portfolio Website  
A personal website built using HTML and CSS.  
It includes my bio, projects, and contact details — and I plan to improve it as I learn more.



Goals

- Learn JavaScript and React  
- Build more real-world projects  
- Start working with real clients as a freelancer
